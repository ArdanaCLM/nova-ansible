  # only allow read access to tty
  # there are three common ways to refer to consoles
  #/dev/console rw,
  #/dev/tty     rw,
  /dev/tty     r,
  # this next entry is a tad unfortunate; /dev/tty will always be
  # associated with the controlling terminal by the kernel, but if a
  # program uses the /dev/pts/ interface, it actually has access to
  # -all- xterm, sshd, etc, terminals on the system.
  /dev/pts/[0-9]*   rw,
  /dev/pts/         r,
